# Reporter Network

## Installation
$virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate
$pip install
$npm install
$bower install
## Editing
If you're planning on editing the look and feel of the project you should navigate to the root and start grunt with:
$grunt watch
Grunt will be watching for changes to the assets/css/main.css file by way of the assets/less/main.less file.
